# Week-2-Code-Challenge
THis is Work Done by Jonathan Mutinda
## Objective:
Develop a webpage with a shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

### Requirements:
Array: 
Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.
DOM Manipulation:
Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. (The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes)
Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items (e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).
Event Handling:
Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.
 Bonus Features:
Allow users to edit existing list items.
Implement persistence using local storage to save the list even after the page reloads.

#### How it Works
Go on Github fork it in you terminal git clone then code . to enter
When you land you see a part telling you about diffrent types of items available(with pictures)
Once you scroll to the bottom there is a text box that you type the item you want to add and once you do you click on the "add", it automatically adds the item and dont worry if you accidentally reload the page it is automatically saved once you click "add"
If you feel like you wan to start a fresh feel free to click "clear"
And to show you have purchaseed an item all you need to do is check them and it stays so you dont forget it at least
Sadly I couldnt allow users to edit existing inputs
